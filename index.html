        <h2>About Scorpion</h2>
        <p>Scorpion is awesome! He is actually an accursed undead specter seeking revenge in the Mortal Kombat tournament. He is a ninja warrior who was killed by his arch-nemesis Sub-Zero (a blue color-swap version of him) survived by a wife and child, and was allowed to return to the physical realms in order to have his revenge. The curse of Scorpion's supernatural existence means he can have his vengeance but can't reunite with his still-living family. Ultimately after the tournament is won by the human champion Liu Kang, Scorpion kills Sub-Zero.</p>
